        Many charities would like to use digital tools to improve their capability, but don't know where to start. Our Digital Check-up will help you to assess your organisationâ€™s current digital maturity and how this compares to other {{@root.data.currentSite.for_plural}} of a comparable size. The check up will help you to identify your strengths and the gaps your organisation is facing in the following areas:
      </p>
      <ul class="mdc-typography--body1">
        <li>Leadership, culture and skills</li>
        <li>Tools and equipment</li>
        <li>Content, marketing and data</li>
        <li>Cyber resilience and online threats</li>
        {{#compare @root.data.currentSite.name "housing" ~}}
        <li>Technology Enabled Care</li>
        {{/compare ~}}
      </ul>
      <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
        Once you have completed the checkup, you can request 1:1 support to explore the resources most relevant to your needs, either through live chat, by booking a phone call or by email.

        <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
          Based on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/essential-digital-skills-framework">Essential Digital Skills Framework</a>, it contains three simple checklists to help you measure where your strengths are and to identify the areas where you may need more support.
